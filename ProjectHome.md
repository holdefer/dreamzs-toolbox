DREAM\_ZS is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that runs multiple chains   in parallel for efficient posterior exploration. It is based on the original DREAM sampling scheme, but uses sampling from an archive of past  states to generate candidate points in each individual chain.
Sampling from past has three main advantages:
(1) Speeds-up convergence to a limiting distribution, especially for high-dimensional problems.
(2) Outlier chains do not need explicit consideration. By sampling historical states, aberrant trajectories an jump directly to the modal region at any time during the  simulation. It maintains detailed balance at every singe step in the chain.
(3) The transition kernel defining the jumps in each of the chains does not require information about the current states of the chains. This is of great advantage in a multi-processor environment where the N candidate points can be generated simultaneously so that each chain can evolve most efficiently on a different computer.                                                     DREAM_(ZS) also contains a snooker updater to maximize the diversity of candidate points  and generate jumps beyond parallel direction updates. Finally, DREAM_(ZS) contains subspace  learning in a similar way as DREAM, to maximize the squared jumping distance between two  subsequent points in each chain.
This software represents a Matlab toolbox to assist researchers in optimizing the parameters of their models.
